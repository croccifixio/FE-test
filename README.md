## Notes

1. Input fields are built using React hooks and debouncing, following this [example](https://dev.to/gabe_ragland/debouncing-with-react-hooks-jci).

2. The integration between Next.js and Redux was heavily inspired by this [article](https://dev.to/saltyshiomix/learn-the-redux-architecture-by-creating-the-minimal-todo-app-on-top-of-next-js-5bpj).
